# Data Processing.zip
It includes the source codes of data processing and the datasets processed.

# Random Forest.zip
It includes the source codes of training and tuning Random Forest regression models. Besides, it includes three trained models with the best combination of hyperparameters so far.

# To Make the Prediction
1. find the id of a district by find_ID.py first
2. load trained models in RF.ipynb and enter inputs to make the prediction

# To Train a new model
1. change the input filename (datesets processed) in RF.ipynb, such as:
   final_count_all.txt, final_fare_all.txt, final_tip_all.txt
2. run the first cell in RF.ipynb

# To Tune the models
Please find the RF_Tune.ipynb
